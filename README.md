Cloudy with a Chance of Neighbors 

I decided to change the direction of this project, so ignore the rest of this document.

The single machine design is highly influnced by [scann](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/scann).


# Run & Build
Currently, you need to have `hdf5` installed on your machine.       
```
go run cmd/example.go
```
